# Caltech EE 148 Final Project: "Dual Task Learning for Species and Attributes Classification"

Automated fine-grain species classification and physical attributes identification are important and challenging problems in ecology. State-of-the-art methods often require large amounts of image labels and natural-language captioning, both of which are labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks. In order to reduce the required amount of labelled data for training neural network-based identification and attribute classification models, we introduce a jointly-optimized model that leverages mutual information between species class and physical features. Our model simultaneously predicts both the species class and a vector of detailed image attributes from an input image. Instead of full natural-language image captions, our approach utilizes binary feature vectors that are annotated to indicate the presence or non-presence of expert pre-defined physical features. This choice of input reduces data-collection labor and time, while still providing valuable details. We test our method on the Caltech-UC San Diego Birds 200-2011 dataset and our key finding is that a dual-task approach improves multi-attribute image labelling F1-score by over $11\%$. As such, we show that our method is capable of providing more accurate fine-grain details of birds than a traditional single-task model, which is useful for ecological research and educational applications.
